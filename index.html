                        <div class=paragraph>Hey, there! My name is Christina- lover of technology, human languages, and problem-solving (business!)
                            <br><br>After spending four years working towards a career in economics, I pivoted towards a career at the intersection of: technology, human languages, 
                            and problem-solving. I realized that life was too short not to pursue what I love, 
                            and what I am intrinsically motivated to work on.

                        <div><h2>About DuoLivre</h2></div>
                        <div class=paragraph>
                            DuoLivre is an idea born out of my experience of years of failed efforts to become truly 
                            fluent in Spanish, and the break-through I had thanks to a conversation at a college party. There, I met a 
                            really interesting guy who spoke beautiful English, despite having learned later in life, as a teenager. 
                            In fact, he was so confident in his English skills, that he claimed to have 
                            better English than most U.S.-born Americans. I asked him, how did he achieve his level of (a) fluency 
                            and (b) confidence? The secret, he said, was to read a lot of books.
                            <br><br>This conversation truly changed my life. After that night, I went to the small Spanish-language 
                            section of my college-town bookstore and bought <i>Un Pez Dos Peces Pez Rojo Pez Azul</i> 
                            (<i>One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish</i>) by Dr. Seuss. 
                            Eventually, I worked up to reading my favorite book in the world in the language that it was originally 
                            written in: <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> by Gabriel García Márquez. For me, this 
                            remains one of my most satisfying accomplishments. 
                            <br><br>Not only did I hit this huge personal milestone (reading the work of García Márquez <i>in Spanish</i>), but in the process 
                            of doing so, my vocabulary, grammatical familiarity, and confidence in Spanish sky-rocketed. Later, I was able to travel and live
                            in Latin America, where I could learn even more. 
                            <br><br>Note that many people go to live in a foreign country and still do not learn the language because 
                            they don't have the baseline confidence or skill-level 
                            to hold a meaningful conversation with native speakers. So, they end up keeping social circles with individuals 
                            who speak their native tongue. It is both understandable and avoidable! The way to avoid this, and to build a solid 
                            foundation in a foreign language -before you travel- is through reading.
                            <br><br>DuoLivre aims to make reading in a foreign language widely accessible and easy-to-do, 
                            with translations to unfamiliar words and phrases at the touch of a button. If you are interested in following 
                            along with the journey of developing DuoLivre, or would like to collaborate on its development (!), please join the
