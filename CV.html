                                I used some programming to ameliorate heavy TA duties in the Fall of 2018. 
                                Specifically, I wrote a web scraping program to automate collection of homework assignments 
                                from the 70 students in my courses, as well as excel VBA to automate some of the grading 
                                for bi-weekly excel homework assignments (typically five pages per assignment per student). 
                                I also was responsible for timely grading and commentary on student essays, due each week.
